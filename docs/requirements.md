# DSENSP Functional & Security Requirements

- **Functional Requirements:**
  - The protocol must dynamically adapt its encryption, routing, and deception parameters in real time.
  - A genetic algorithm (GA) must continuously evolve protocol parameters based on simulated network conditions.
  - The system must simulate realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
  - All protocol events and evolution steps must be logged with immutable audit trails.
  - Provide interfaces for monitoring, testing, and analysis.

- **Security Requirements:**
  - Dynamic encryption schemes with frequent key changes.
  - Adaptive routing strategies that can isolate compromised nodes.
  - Honeypot/deception modules to lure and neutralize attackers.
  - Robust logging and audit mechanisms for forensic analysis.
  - Decentralized, self-healing operation with no single point of failure.
