# Patent Application Draft for DSENSP

## Title:
Dynamic Self‐Evolving Network Security Protocol

## Abstract:
A network security protocol that continuously adapts its entire communication stack—including dynamic encryption, adaptive routing, and deception mechanisms—via a genetic algorithm. This system autonomously evolves to counteract evolving cyber threats in real time while maintaining immutable audit trails.

## Claims (Summary):
1. A method of dynamically evolving network protocol parameters using a genetic algorithm based on real-time network performance metrics.
2. Integration of multi-layer security modules (cryptography, routing, deception) with cross-layer coordination.
3. A simulation engine to evaluate protocol performance and guide evolutionary updates.
4. A decentralized, self-healing network that automatically isolates compromised nodes.
5. An immutable logging system for tracking protocol events and evolution.
